gcloud bash scripts
===================

These scripts were developed and tested on Fedora where the orangefs
userspace package can be dnf installed. The servers.sh script makes use
of some commands from the package, pvfs2-genconfig in particular. Installation
of the package results in orangefs commands residing along the default
search path. If these scripts are run from someplace other than
fedora, the orangefs userspace tools will have to be installed
some other way, from an downloaded rpm or built from source. This is
fine, but you'll have to insure that the orangefs commands are in the $PATH.

These scripts build an orangefs server cluster whose instances are
based on an image in the google cloud. The image will need to support
ext4 and be based on some recent kernel version that includes the
Orangefs kernel module. Orangefs first went upstream in Linux 4.3
and had major page cache enhancements at 5.2. The image will need
to have the orangefs userspace parts installed and servers.sh expects
them to be installed in /opt/orangefs.

"./servers.sh -a3 -i8 -m1 gc-object" will create an eight server
orangefs cluster with one metadata server. Three verification
attempts will be made to each server before the whole thing
gives up.

 ./servers.sh
USAGE: ./servers.sh [args] gc-object
-aX	X = max number of verification attempts
-iX	X = number of io servers
-mX	X = number of metadata servers

"./servers_off.sh gc-object" will attempt to stop and delete instances
gc-object1, gc-object2 and so forth, quitting when we try to stop
and delete something that doesn't exist.

 ./servers_off.sh
USAGE: ./servers_off.sh object-name
